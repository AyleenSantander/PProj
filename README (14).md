## Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | Kaggle — Breast Cancer Analysis |
| Origin | University of Calabar Teaching Hospital Cancer Registry |
| Period | January 2019 – August 2021 |
| Records | 213 raw → 211 after cleaning |
| Features | 11 raw → 8 predictors |
| Target | `Diagnosis Result` — Benign (119) / Malignant (92) |

### Predictors

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Age | Numeric | Patient age at diagnosis (13–77) |
| Menopause | Binary | Menopausal status at diagnosis |
| Tumor Size (cm) | Numeric | Size of the excised tumour |
| Inv-Nodes | Numeric | Axillary lymph nodes containing metastatic tissue |
| Breast | Categorical | Left / Right |
| Metastasis | Binary | Cancer present elsewhere in the body |
| Breast Quadrant | Categorical | Upper/Lower × Inner/Outer |
| History | Binary | Family history of breast cancer |

`S/N` and `Year` were dropped as identifiers carrying no signal.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing

The raw file used `#` as a placeholder for missing data across both numeric and categorical columns. Handling:

- Categorical columns — stripped, title-cased, `#` mapped to an explicit `Unknown` level
- Numeric columns — `#` coerced to `NaN` via `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')`
- Remaining rows with nulls dropped (213 → 211)

All transformations are wrapped in a `ColumnTransformer` inside a `Pipeline`, so imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding are fitted **only on training folds**. This prevents data leakage during cross-validation.

```
ColumnTransformer
├── num → SimpleImputer(median) → StandardScaler
└── cat → SimpleImputer(most_frequent) → OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
```

### Train/test split

Stratified 80/20 split — 168 train / 43 test. Class balance held at 56.5/43.5 in train vs 55.8/44.2 in test.

### Models compared

Logistic Regression · Decision Tree · Random Forest · SVM · KNN

Each was tuned with `GridSearchCV` (5-fold stratified, F1 scoring), then validated with `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` (5 splits × 10 repeats) for a stable estimate.

## Results

### Repeated cross-validation (50 folds, F1)

| Model | Mean ± Std | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Decision Tree | 0.877 ± 0.062 | 0.720 – 0.966 |
| SVM | 0.876 ± 0.065 | 0.750 – 1.000 |
| KNN | 0.875 ± 0.064 | 0.750 – 1.000 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.873 ± 0.065 | 0.750 – 1.000 |
| Random Forest | 0.862 ± 0.064 | 0.741 – 0.966 |

All five models are statistically indistinguishable. The 0.015 spread sits well inside a standard deviation of ~0.064.

### Nested cross-validation

**0.840 ± 0.036** — the honest generalization estimate.

The ~0.04 gap below the standard CV figure of 0.877 is optimism introduced by hyperparameter tuning; the grid search partially fitted the validation folds. Nested CV removes that bias by keeping model selection inside an inner loop.

### Held-out test set (Decision Tree, n=43)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.907 |
| Precision (Malignant) | 0.941 |
| Recall (Malignant) | 0.842 |
| F1 (Malignant) | 0.889 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.958 |

Confusion matrix: **TN=23, FP=1, FN=3, TP=16**

The three false negatives are the errors that matter. In a diagnostic context a missed malignancy costs far more than a false alarm sent for follow-up imaging.

## Key findings

**Threshold tuning matters more than model choice.** The tuned Decision Tree has only four leaves, producing just four distinct probabilities (0.00, 0.19, 0.64, 1.00). Any threshold between 0.20 and 0.60 gives identical predictions — the cutoff is effectively uncontrollable. Logistic Regression yields continuous probabilities and makes the trade-off visible:

| Threshold | Recall | Precision | Missed | False alarms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3 | 0.842 | 0.941 | 3 | 1 |
| 0.5 | 0.789 | 1.000 | 4 | 0 |

Moving from 0.5 to 0.3 catches one more cancer at the cost of one unnecessary follow-up. For a diagnostic screen that is the correct direction. The 0.5 default is a convention, not an optimum.

**Feature selection gave no improvement.** RFECV retained 9 of 9 encoded features and scored 0.858 ± 0.062 against 0.877 ± 0.062 for the full set — equivalent within noise. The pipeline places RFECV *inside* the cross-validation loop, so selection is refit per fold rather than on the full dataset.

**Regularization helps modestly and the type doesn't matter.**

| Configuration | F1 |
|---|---|
| No penalty | 0.841 ± 0.063 |
| L2 (Ridge) | 0.859 ± 0.061 |
| L1 (Lasso) | 0.860 ± 0.061 |
| ElasticNet | 0.859 ± 0.060 |

Tuned best: `C=0.1, penalty='l1'` at F1 0.868. The regularization path shows classic overfitting — as `C` increases, train F1 climbs to 0.905 while validation drops to 0.829. L1 at `C=0.1` zeroed 10 of 14 coefficients, leaving Inv-Nodes, Tumor Size, Metastasis, and Age.

**Permutation importance** ranks Tumor Size (0.127) and Inv-Nodes (0.126) far above everything else, followed by Menopause (0.069) and Breast Quadrant (0.048). Breast side, Metastasis, and History contributed nothing measurable to the tree.

**Learning curve** shows train and validation converging with validation still climbing at 135 training examples — more data would improve performance.

## Deployment

Gradio interface with three tabs:

- **Single patient** — sliders and dropdowns for each predictor, colour-coded result with a probability bar and certainty label
- **Batch (CSV)** — upload a file, get scored rows plus a downloadable `predictions.csv`
- **About** — dataset, method, and limitations

The model artifact is a dictionary containing the fitted pipeline, decision threshold, and feature list, serialized with `joblib`. Bundling the feature names guards against column-order drift at inference time.

```python
artifact = {
    'model': best_model,       # fitted Pipeline
    'threshold': best_threshold,
    'features': X_train.columns.tolist(),
}
```

### Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Files

```
├── app.py                        # Gradio interface
├── breast_cancer_model.pkl       # serialized pipeline + threshold + features
├── requirements.txt
└── M11_FinalProject_Breast_Cancer.ipynb
```

`requirements.txt` pins `scikit-learn==1.6.1` to match the training environment — unpickling across versions fails.

## Limitations

- **Small sample.** 211 records, 43 in the test set. One patient shifts test accuracy by 2.3 points, so model rankings from the test set are not meaningful.
- **Single source.** One hospital registry over 24 months. No external validation cohort.
- **No calibration.** Predicted probabilities have not been calibrated, so they should be read as scores rather than true risk estimates.
- **Not clinically validated.** This is a coursework demonstration of an end-to-end ML workflow, not a diagnostic tool.
